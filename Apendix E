Appendix E: Re-evaluating the Khafre Valley Temple as a Megalithic Dock

E.1 Reconsidering Mortuary Interpretations
Conventional Egyptological interpretations of the Khafre Valley Temple (KVT) predominantly describe it as a ceremonial or mortuary complex, attributed to its proximity to the Sphinx and the broader funerary architecture (Lehner, 1997; Hawass, 2003). However, such perspectives often overlook the substantial logistical demands associated with the transport and handling of 150-tonne granite blocks from Aswan, as well as the architectural characteristics that suggest practical functionality.

While typically characterised as a T-shaped ritual hall, the KVT also features a recessed U-shaped basin, defined by lateral granite retaining walls and a lowered central courtyard. As demonstrated through the engineering simulations in this study (Figure 4; Appendix D), such geometry offers notable advantages for the secure reception and stabilisation of megaliths up to 50 tonnes. Unlike the inclined ramps evident at sites such as Wadi al-Jarf, the KVT’s structural configuration appears optimised for direct fluvial offloading—echoing specialised infrastructural strategies observed in early urban Neolithic contexts, including Sumerian quays and the dockyards at Lothal (Algaze, 2008; Rao, 1979).

E.2 Geomorphological and Topographical Considerations
The KVT is located within the lowest natural depression along the eastern margin of the Giza Plateau, coinciding with a palaeochannel traceable in satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEMs), and mid-Holocene hydrological reconstructions (Butzer, 1976). During the highstand conditions of c. 4400 BCE, this recessed position would have been subject to episodic or seasonal inundation, situating the temple within an ideal corridor for barge-based material delivery. The integration of such geomorphological affordances strengthens the case for its use as a functional logistics hub rather than a structure of purely symbolic purpose.

E.3 Structural Configuration and Load-Bearing Capacity
The foundation of the KVT comprises over 100 Aswan granite blocks, each weighing as much as 150 tonnes and laid directly upon the bedrock substrate (Lehner, 1997). This arrangement ensures exceptional compressive strength and lateral stability—characteristics that exceed the requirements of a symbolic structure but correspond precisely to the demands of heavy-load reception and secure anchoring. Comparisons with contemporaneous sites such as Lisht and Wadi al-Jarf reveal that the KVT’s uniquely recessed profile may represent a regionally specific tradition of hydraulic engineering, adapted to the needs of monumental-scale construction logistics.

E.4 Functional Transition and Adaptive Reuse
Archaeological findings from the central courtyard—including over 150 bread moulds and altar fragments dated to ~3200–3000 BCE (Lehner et al., 2015)—suggest a secondary ritual phase following environmental regression after ~3500 BCE. This pattern mirrors functional transitions observed at other sites, such as Dahshur and Lisht, where originally utilitarian spaces were recontextualised for ceremonial purposes amid shifting hydrological regimes (Arnold, 1991). Notably, artefact assemblages at Lisht exhibit comparable bread mould concentrations (~200), reinforcing the interpretation of a broader cultural response to environmental decline through symbolic repurposing.

E.5 Testable Predictions for Future Investigation
Geoarchaeological investigations of the KVT’s eastern forecourt could yield stratified sedimentary sequences consistent with periodic fluvial inundation. Further, microscopic tool-wear patterns on floor surfaces or the discovery of recessed mooring slots could provide functional signatures of megalith handling. To empirically constrain chronology, non-invasive dating techniques—such as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) on buried alluvium, or cosmogenic nuclide analysis (e.g., ¹⁰Be exposure dating) on granite surfaces—may offer valuable temporal anchors for mid-Holocene activity. Stratigraphic resolution of episodic high-energy depositional layers would further corroborate the docking hypothesis.
