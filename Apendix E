## Re-evaluating the Khafre Valley Temple as a Megalithic Dock  
### Limitations of Ritual-Centric Interpretations

#### E.1 Critique of Conventional Mortuary Interpretations
Prevailing Egyptological interpretations of the Khafre Valley Temple (KVT) have largely framed it as a mortuary or ceremonial installation, primarily due to its spatial association with the Sphinx and adjacent funerary architecture (Lehner 1997; Hawass 2003). However, such perspectives often overlook the engineering, hydrological, and logistical implications of transporting 150-tonne granite blocks from Aswan. To date, no comprehensive structural analysis has been conducted to evaluate the KVT’s potential function as a docking platform.

Although traditionally classified as a T-shaped ritual hall, the KVT exhibits features more consistent with a recessed U-shaped basin—such as flanking granite walls and a lowered central courtyard—offering functional advantages for the offloading of large megaliths. Engineering simulations presented in this study (Figure 4; Appendix D) confirm that this configuration ensures load stability for blocks weighing up to 50 tonnes. While other Old Kingdom ports, such as those at Wadi al-Jarf, employed inclined ramps for terrestrial access, the recessed profile of the KVT suggests a more specialised hydraulic engineering solution designed for direct fluvial unloading.

#### E.2 Topographical and Geomorphological Context
The KVT occupies the lowest natural depression along the Giza Plateau’s eastern margin, adjacent to a palaeochannel identified in satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEMs), and hydrological reconstructions (Butzer 1976). During the mid-Holocene highstand (~4400 BCE), this area would have experienced sustained or seasonal inundation, positioning the temple ideally for barge-based logistics.

#### E.3 Structural Configuration and Load-Bearing Characteristics
The temple’s foundation comprises over 100 red granite blocks from Aswan, each weighing up to 150 tonnes (Lehner 1997), directly placed upon bedrock. This configuration offers superior compressive strength and lateral stability—attributes inconsistent with a symbolic or exclusively ritual function, yet fully compatible with high-load unloading operations.

#### E.4 Functional Transition and Adaptive Reuse
Archaeological finds—such as bread moulds and altar fragments in the central courtyard (Lehner et al. 2015)—suggest a secondary ceremonial phase following the decline of the temple’s hydraulic utility after the Nile’s regression post-3500 BCE. Comparable patterns of ritual reoccupation have been documented at sites including Dahshur and Lisht, where originally functional spaces were later repurposed for cultic activities (Arnold 1991).

#### E.5 Testable Predictions for Future Investigation
Future geoarchaeological surveys of the KVT’s eastern basin may yield stratified sediment layers indicative of prolonged inundation, tool wear patterns associated with megalith handling, or embedded anchor points along the quay. Such findings would provide critical empirical validation for the docking hypothesis proposed herein—bridging predictive modelling with archaeological confirmation.
